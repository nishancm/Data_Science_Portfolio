# Introduction

In this project we build a machine learning pipeline to predict flight delays. Data for this project are extracted from [here](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html). Tasks involved are,

* Store data in AWS S3
* Spun up a spark ec2-cluster with master and 2 slaves
* Load data in to MongoDB installed in the cluster
* Clean the data and convert in to a SparkSQL table
* Apply Random Forest algorithm in SparkML to predict flight delays

Also refer the slide deck for the process followed and the results.
