# Introduction

In this project we are hosting a web application in AWS to help people plan pub crawls. This application was built as part of the San Francisco Beer Week and presented at the "Beer and Data Science" event held at University of San Francisco downtown campus. Pubs available for crawling in the app are breweries of San Francisco who participated in Beer Week along with couple of taprooms. You can play around with the application using following [link](http://ec2-34-229-40-206.compute-1.amazonaws.com:3838/sample-apps/beer-week-5/)
